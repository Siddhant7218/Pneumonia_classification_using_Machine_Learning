Title: Pneumonia Classification Using Machine Learning

Platform: Python, ML, CNN, GitHub 

Description:  This study introduces a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to classify and detect pneumonia
from chest X-ray images. The model, trained from scratch, uses convolutional layers to extract key features from
the images, enabling early and accurate pneumonia prediction. The approach aims to enhance pneumonia
detection with advanced machine-learning techniques.
